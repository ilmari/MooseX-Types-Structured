=head1 NAME

MooseX::Types::Structured; Structured Type Constraints for Moose

=head1 SYNOPSIS

The following is example usage for this module.  You can define a class that has
an attribute with a structured type like so:

	package MyApp::MyClass;
	
	use Moose;
	use MooseX::Types::Moose qw(Str Int);
	use MooseX::Types::Structured qw(Dict Tuple);
	
	has name => (isa=>Dict[first_name=>Str, last_name=>Str]);
	
Then you can instantiate this class with something like:

	my $instance = MyApp::MyClass->new(
		name=>{first_name=>'John', last_name=>'Napiorkowski'},
	);

But all of these would cause an error:

	my $instance = MyApp::MyClass->new(name=>'John');
	my $instance = MyApp::MyClass->new(name=>{first_name=>'John'});
	my $instance = MyApp::MyClass->new(name=>{first_name=>'John', age=>39});

Please see the test cases for more examples.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This type library enables structured type constraints. Basically, this is very
similar to parameterized constraints that are built into the core Moose types,
except that you are allowed to define the container's entire structure.  For
example, you could define a parameterized constraint like so:

	subtype HashOfInts, as Hashref[Int];

which would constraint a value to something like [1,2,3,...] and so one.  A
structured constraint like so:

	subtype StringFollowedByInt, as Tuple[Str,Int];
	
would constrain it's value to something like ['hello', 111];

These structures can be as simple or elaborate as you wish.  You can even
combine various structured, parameterized and simple constraints all together:

	subtype crazy, as Tuple[Int, Dict[name=>Str, age=>Int], ArrayRef[Int]];
	
Which would match "[1, {name=>'John', age=>25},[10,11,12]]".

You should exercise some care as to whether or not your complex structured
constraints would be better off contained by a real object as in the following
example:

	{
		package MyApp::MyStruct;
		use Moose;
		
			has $_ for qw(name age);
		
		package MyApp::MyClass;
		use Moose;
		
			has person => (isa=>'MyApp::MyStruct');		
	}

	my $instance = MyApp::MyClass
		->new( person=>MyApp::MyStruct->new(name=>'John', age=>39) );
	
This method may take some additional time to setup but will give you more
flexibility.  However, structured constraints are highly compatible with this
method, granting some interesting possibilities for coercion.  Try:

	subtype 'MyStruct',
	 as 'MyApp::MyStruct';
	 
	coerce 'MyStruct',
	 from (Dict[name=>Str, age=>Int]),
	 via {
		MyApp::MyStruct->new(%$_);
	 },
	 from (Dict[last_name=>Str, first_name=>Str, dob=>DateTime]),
	 via {
		my $name = _->{first_name} .' '. $_->{last_name};
		my $age = $_->{dob} - DateTime->now;
		MyApp::MyStruct->new(
			name=>$name,
			age=>$age->years );
	 };
	

=head1 TYPES

This class defines the following types and subtypes.

sub Tuple {
	my ($args, $optional) = @_;
	my @args = @$args;
	my @optional = ref $optional eq 'ARRAY' ? @$optional : ();

		name => 'Tuple',
		parent => find_type_constraint('ArrayRef'),
		package_defined_in => __PACKAGE__,
		signature => [map {
			_normalize_type_constraint($_);

		} keys %args},
		optional_signature => {map {
			$_ => _normalize_type_constraint($optional{$_});
		} keys %optional},
	);
}

sub _normalize_type_constraint {
	my $tc = shift @_;
	
	## If incoming is an object, we will assume it's something that implements
	## what a type constraint is.  We should probably have a Role for this...
	if(defined $tc && blessed $tc) {
		return $tc;
	} elsif($tc) {
		return Moose::Util::TypeConstraints::find_or_parse_type_constraint($tc);
	}
